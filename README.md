## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (for local model hosting)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, for advanced web agent features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdmusab123/OmniNexus.git
   cd OmniNexus
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python -m playwright install chromium
   ```

3. **Set Up Models:**
   Ensure Ollama is running and pull the necessary models:
   ```bash
   ollama pull gemma
   ollama pull qwen2:0.5b
   ollama pull llava
   ```

4. **Launch OmniNexus:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Access the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 🧩 Advanced Features

### Interactive 3D Brain Map
OmniNexus features a unique **Memory Constellation**—a 3D interactive graph that visualizes how the AI connects concepts, entities, and long-term memories in real-time.

### Autonomous Swarm Routing
The project uses a high-speed nano-model (Qwen 0.5b) as a router, ensuring near-instantaneous task classification without the overhead of larger models.
